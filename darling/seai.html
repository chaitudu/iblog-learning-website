        <h1 class="font1">Alogrithams of Ai</h1>
        <p class="font1">These biases can be passed into Artificial Intelligence Bias in
            AI systems when they are trained on data that includes human biases, historical inequalities,
            or different metrics of judgement based on gender, race, nationality, sexual orientation, etc. of
            humans. For example, Amazon found out that their AI recruiting algorithm was biased against women.
            This algorithm was based on the number of resumes submitted over the past 10 years and the candidates hired.
            And since most of the candidates were men, so the algorithm also favored men over women. As you can see from
            this example, biases in Artificial Intelligence causes a lot of damage. This bias hurts the chances of the
            biased group
            to participate fully in the world and provide equal benefits to the economy. And while it hurts the groups
            that the
            algorithm is biased against, it also hurts the trust of humans in the artificial intelligence algorithms to
            work without
            bias. It reduces the chances of Artificial Intelligence being used in all aspects of business and industry
            as this produces
            mistrust and the fear that people may be discriminated against. So technical industries that produce these
            artificial
            intelligence algorithms need to ensure that their algorithms are bias-free before releasing them in the
            market.
            Companies can do this by encouraging research on Artificial Intelligence Bias to eradicate bias in the
            future.
            But before this can happen, we also need to know the examples where Artificial Intelligence Bias was
            demonstrated by
            different algorithms. So letâ€™s see them so that we can understand what algorithms should not do in the
            coming times.
