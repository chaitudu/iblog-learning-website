                <dd>Our website is for the people who want to learn about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                    On our website you will be getting various articles and stuffs. Other than this you can learn more
                    about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from our site and get to know various new things
                    about Artificial Intellligence and Machine Learning.

                    Our aim to spread knowledge regarding Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to the people who
                    are unaware about this and also to the future generation. Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                    Learning are one of the most booming industries these days. With the help of this many countries are
                    taking there technology to next level and India is one of them.

                <dd>Linux is a community of open-source Unix like operat ing systems that are based on the Linux Kernel.
                    It was initially released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. It is a free and open-source
                    operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or
                    noncommercially under the GNU General Public License.
                    Initially, Linux was created for personal computers and gradually it was used in other machines like
                    servers, mainframe computers, supercomputers, etc. Nowadays, Linux is also used in embedded systems
                    like routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles,
                    smartwatches, etc. The biggest success of Linux is Android(operating system) it is based on the
                    Linux kernel that is running on smartphones and tablets. Due to android Linux has the largest

                    layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. It is responsible for the End to
                    End Delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the
                    successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

                    Segmentation, and also implements Flow & Error control to ensure proper data transmission. It also
                    adds Source and Destination port numbers in its header and forwards the segmented data to the
