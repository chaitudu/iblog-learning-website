        <h1 class="font1">artifical intelligence</h1>
        <p class="font1">The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they 
            can act intelligently!”, but the question is how much intelligent? How can one judge intelligence? 

            …as intelligent as humans. If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by 
            improving on their own from past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”. 
            Thus, the AI systems are more generic(rather than specific), can “think” and are more flexible. 
            
            Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the information 
            acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training). Summing the terms up, 
            we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and 
            applying the information it has gained through exposure.” 
            
            Intelligence is composed of:  
            
            Reasoning
            Learning
            Problem Solving
            Perception
            Linguistic Intelligence
            Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, and methods based 
            on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, 
            philosophy, neuroscience, artificial psychology, and many others. 
            
            Need for Artificial Intelligence  
            
            To create expert systems that exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, 
            explain, and advise its users.
            Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a 
            computer-friendly manner.
